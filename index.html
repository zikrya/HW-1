        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>The origins of Batman revolve around a tragic event in his childhood. As a young boy named Bruce Wayne, he witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, during a robbery in the crime-infested city of Gotham. This traumatic incident left a lasting impact on Bruce. Determined to fight crime and ensure that no one else suffers like he did, Bruce dedicated his life to training his mind and body to peak human condition. He traveled the world, studying various martial arts, detective skills, and scientific knowledge.During his training, Bruce came across a cave filled with bats, which sparked an idea. He decided to adopt the persona of Batman, a symbol of fear and justice, to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. He developed a suit, gadgets, and a signature Batmobile to aid him in his mission.Returning to Gotham, Batman set out to cleanse the city of corruption and crime. He used his vast resources as the billionaire owner of Wayne Enterprises to fund his crime-fighting activities. By night, he patrolled the dark streets of Gotham, taking on a rogues' gallery of villains, including The Joker, Catwoman, and The Riddler.
